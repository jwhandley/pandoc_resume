Experience
----------

**Data Analytics Economist, Ofcom**

September 2022 - present

- Conducted comprehensive literature review on the impact of online intermediaries on political polarisation

- Pioneered original research into the relationship between online intermediaries and the diversity of news consumption
  * Used topic modelling to identify clusters of similar articles in a large web-tracking dataset
  
  * Showed that the diversity (entropy) of topics is lower for individuals with a higher proportion of social media in their news diets

- Given Impact Award for these research contributions


**Research Assistant for the WEALTHPOL project, University of Oxford**

- Searched through Japanese national archives to uncover inheritance tax schedules from 1945 to 2020
  * This involved reading the original Japanese which is often quite different to contemporary Japanese
  
  * Because of this I was able to identify a flaw in the original dataset, improving our understanding of the development of inheritance taxation in post-war Japan

Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **R:** I have experience using R to analyse social surveys like the British Election Study and
    microdata from large-scale official surveys like the Current Population survey. One example
    is a recent project implementing Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification for England
    and Wales using the BES and the 2021 Census available [here][ref1]. I have also recently 
    used the ONS sub-national indicators dataset to run a simple cluster analysis for Local Authorities
    in Great Britain [here][ref2].

:   **Python:** Most of my Python work is closed source at Ofcom, but I have a few simple
    projects such as [this][ref3] that fits a Doc2Vec model to speeches made in the
    House of Commons from 1979 to 2021 to find words and phrases most associated with
    each party in each parliament.

:   **Stan:** I have used Stan to fit state space models of [political opinion polls](https://johnhandley.substack.com/p/building-a-bayesian-poll-of-polls)

:   **Rust:** I have basic knowledge of Rust and have written some [basic command line utilities](ref4).

Other skills and experience
----------------------------------------

* Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * Japanese

* I have written a [report](https://www.smf.co.uk/publications/uk-vs-us-living-standards/) for the Social Market Foundation using data from the 2017 Purchasing Power Parity benchmark to decompose the gap in living standards between the US and the UK
