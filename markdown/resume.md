Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **R:** I have experience using R to analyse social surveys like the British Election Study and
    microdata from large-scale offical surveys like the Current Population survey. One example
    is a recent project implementing Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification for England
    and Wales using the BES and the 2021 Census available [here][ref1]. I have also recently 
    used the ONS subnational indicators dataset to run a simple cluster analysis for Local Authorities
    in Great Britain [here][ref2].

:   **Python:** Most of my Python work is closed source at Ofcom, but I have a few simple
    projects such as [this][ref3] that fits a Doc2Vec model to speeches made in the
    House of Commons from 1979 to 2021 to find words and phrases most associated with
    each party in each parliament.

:   **Stan:** I have used Stan to fit state space models of [political opinion polls](https://johnhandley.substack.com/p/building-a-bayesian-poll-of-polls)

:   Basic knowledge of **Rust**
